            👋 Hello @${{ github.actor }}, thank you for submitting a YOLO 🚀 PR! To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:

            - ✅ Verify your PR is **up-to-date** with `ultralytics/hub` `master` branch. If your PR is behind you can update your code by clicking the 'Update branch' button or by running `git pull` and `git merge main` locally.
            - ✅ Verify all Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.
            - ✅ Update [Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com) for any new or updated features.
            - ✅ Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_  — Bruce Lee
