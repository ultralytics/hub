# Ultralytics coco8-human Dataset

The Ultralytics coco8-human dataset is a compact yet versatile collection of 8 images sourced from the COCO 2017 training set, divided evenly into 4 images for training and 4 for validation. Each image is annotated with bounding boxes around humans and detailed attributes such as weight (kg), height (cm), gender (0: female, 1: male), age (years), and ethnicity (0: Asian, 1: White, 2: Middle Eastern, 3: Indian, 4: Latino, 5: Black).

Despite its small size, this dataset provides sufficient diversity to effectively test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before scaling up to larger datasets. It is specifically designed for use with Ultralytics YOLOv8.

This dataset is intended for use with Ultralytics YOLOv8.
