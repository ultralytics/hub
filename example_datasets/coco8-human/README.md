# Ultralytics coco8-human Dataset

The **Ultralytics `coco8-human` dataset** is a compact, attribute-rich dataset designed for rapid testing and development within the [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) ecosystem. It consists of 8 carefully selected images from the [COCO 2017 training set](https://cocodataset.org/#home), making it ideal for validating pipelines and experimenting with new features.

These 8 images are split evenly, with 4 images for training and 4 for validation. Each image is annotated for the **'person'** class, including standard [bounding boxes](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/bounding-box) and detailed human attributes:

- **Weight (kg)**
- **Height (cm)**
- **Gender** (0: female, 1: male)
- **Age (years)**
- **Ethnicity**  
  (0: Asian, 1: White, 2: Middle Eastern, 3: Indian, 4: Latino, 5: Black)

Despite its small size, the `coco8-human` dataset provides enough diversity to effectively test [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) [training pipelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/) for errors or serve as a quick sanity check before scaling up to larger datasets such as the [full COCO dataset](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/). It is particularly useful for experimenting with models like [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/), [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/), and other [YOLO model versions](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/).

This dataset is fully compatible with the Ultralytics framework and integrates seamlessly with [Ultralytics HUB](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/), enabling fast prototyping and validation.
