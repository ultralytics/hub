# Ultralytics COCO8-pose Dataset

## üåü Introduction

Welcome to the Ultralytics COCO8-pose dataset! This is a compact yet versatile dataset designed for **pose estimation** tasks within the broader field of [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision). It features the first 8 images sourced from the well-known [COCO train 2017 set](https://cocodataset.org/#home), thoughtfully split into 4 images for training and 4 for validation.

COCO8-pose is particularly useful for quickly testing and debugging [pose estimation](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/pose-estimation-with-ultralytics-yolov8) models, experimenting with new [machine learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) or [pose estimation approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08008), or verifying the integrity of your [training pipelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/). Its small size (only 8 images) makes it highly manageable, while still offering enough diversity to serve as a practical sanity check before scaling up to larger [datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/).

This dataset is optimized for use with [Ultralytics HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com/) and the [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) model. Get started quickly using the [Ultralytics HUB Quickstart](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/quickstart/) guide.
