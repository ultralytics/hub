# Ultralytics COCO8-pose Dataset

## Introduction

[Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) COCO8-pose is a small, but versatile pose detection dataset composed of the first
8 images of the COCO train 2017 set, 4 for training and 4 for validation. This dataset is ideal for testing and
debugging object detection models, or for experimenting with new detection approaches. With 8 images, it is small enough
to be easily manageable, yet diverse enough to test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before
training larger datasets.

This dataset is intended for use with Ultralytics [HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com)
and [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
