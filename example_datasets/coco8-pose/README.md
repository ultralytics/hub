# Ultralytics COCO8-pose Dataset

## üåü Introduction

Welcome to the Ultralytics COCO8-pose dataset! This compact and versatile dataset is designed for **pose estimation** tasks within the broader field of [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv). It contains the first 8 images from the [COCO train 2017 set](https://cocodataset.org/#home), thoughtfully divided into 4 images for training and 4 for validation.

COCO8-pose is ideal for quickly testing and debugging [pose estimation](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/pose-estimation-with-ultralytics-yolov8) models, experimenting with new [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) or [pose estimation approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08008), and verifying the integrity of your [training pipelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/). Its small size (just 8 images) makes it highly manageable, while still providing enough diversity for practical sanity checks before scaling up to larger [datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/).

This dataset is optimized for use with [Ultralytics HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com/) and the latest [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) models. Get started quickly by following the [Ultralytics HUB Quickstart guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/quickstart/).
