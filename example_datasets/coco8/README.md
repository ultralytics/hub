# Ultralytics COCO8 Dataset

## üöÄ Introduction

[Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) COCO8 is a compact yet versatile [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) dataset. It comprises the first 8 images from the widely-used [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/) train 2017 set, specifically 4 images for training and 4 for validation. Originating from the extensive [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home), COCO8 serves as an excellent tool for quick tests.

This dataset is perfectly suited for **testing and debugging** object detection models within the Ultralytics ecosystem, or for experimenting with new detection methodologies. Its small size (8 images) makes it highly manageable for verifying training pipelines, serving as a crucial **sanity check** before committing to training on [larger datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/). It's particularly useful for ensuring your setup works correctly with Ultralytics [HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com/) and [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). You can get started with training on COCO8 with YOLOv8 by following the [Ultralytics Quickstart guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/).

## üñºÔ∏è Sample Images and Annotations

The COCO8 dataset features diverse images with multiple objects and complex scenes. Below is an example showcasing images from the dataset, along with their corresponding annotations visualized as a training mosaic. This illustrates the variety and complexity captured within this small dataset.
