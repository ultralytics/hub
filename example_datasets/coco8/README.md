# Ultralytics COCO8 Dataset

## Introduction

[Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) COCO8 is a small, but versatile object detection dataset composed of the first 8 images of the COCO train 2017 set, 4 for training and 4 for validation. This dataset is ideal for testing and debugging object detection models, or for experimenting with new detection approaches. With 8 images, it is small enough to be easily manageable, yet diverse enough to test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before training larger datasets.

This dataset is intended for use with Ultralytics [HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com/) and [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

## Sample Images and Annotations

Here are some examples of images from the dataset, along with their corresponding annotations in a training mosaic:
