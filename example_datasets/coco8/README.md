# Ultralytics COCO8 Dataset

## üöÄ Introduction

The [Ultralytics COCO8 dataset](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco8/) is a compact and versatile resource for [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) tasks. It consists of the first 8 images from the popular [COCO train 2017 dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home), split into 4 images for training and 4 for validation. This small dataset is ideal for **quick testing, debugging, and validating** your object detection pipelines within the [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) ecosystem.

COCO8 is especially useful for verifying your setup before scaling up to [larger datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/), making it a valuable **sanity check** for model training, data loading, and annotation workflows. Its manageable size ensures rapid iteration, whether you are experimenting with new detection strategies or ensuring compatibility with [Ultralytics HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com/) and [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/). To get started with training on COCO8, follow the [Ultralytics Quickstart guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/).

## üñºÔ∏è Sample Images and Annotations

COCO8 features diverse scenes with multiple objects, providing a realistic testing ground for object detection models. Below is a sample visualization from the dataset, displaying annotated images in a training mosaic. This highlights the variety and complexity present, even in a small dataset.
