# Ultralytics DOTA8 Dataset

## üìÑ Introduction

[Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) DOTA8 is a small yet versatile dataset for **oriented object detection (OBB)**. It comprises 8 images derived from the [DOTAv1 dataset](https://captain-whu.github.io/DOTA/dataset.html), split equally with 4 images for training and 4 for validation. This dataset is specifically designed for testing and debugging [OBB models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/obb/), or for experimenting with new detection approaches within the Ultralytics ecosystem.

Containing only 8 images, DOTA8 is easily manageable, making it perfect for verifying [training pipelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/) for errors and serving as a quick sanity check before committing to training on larger datasets. Its diversity, despite the small size, ensures a basic level of challenge for model evaluation.

This dataset is intended for use with [Ultralytics HUB](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/) and the [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) model.
