# Ultralytics DOTA8 Dataset

## üìÑ Introduction

The **Ultralytics DOTA8** dataset is a compact and versatile resource for **oriented object detection (OBB)** tasks. It contains 8 images sampled from the [DOTAv1 dataset](https://captain-whu.github.io/DOTA/dataset.html), split evenly with 4 images for training and 4 for validation. DOTA8 is specifically crafted for rapid testing, debugging, and experimentation with [OBB models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/obb/) in the Ultralytics ecosystem.

Despite its small size, DOTA8 offers a diverse set of scenarios, making it ideal for quickly verifying [training pipelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/) and ensuring your setup is error-free before scaling up to larger datasets. Its simplicity enables fast iteration and serves as a reliable sanity check for model evaluation and development.

DOTA8 is fully compatible with [Ultralytics HUB](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/) and the latest [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) models, empowering users to streamline their OBB workflows.
