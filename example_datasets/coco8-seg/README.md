# Ultralytics COCO8-seg Dataset

## Introduction

[Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) COCO8-seg is a small, but versatile instance segmentation dataset composed of the
first 8 images of the COCO train 2017 set, 4 for training and 4 for validation. This dataset is ideal for testing and
debugging segmentation models, or for experimenting with new detection approaches. With 8 images, it is small enough to
be easily manageable, yet diverse enough to test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before training
larger datasets.

This dataset is intended for use with Ultralytics [HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com)
and [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
