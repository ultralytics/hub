# Ultralytics COCO8-seg Dataset

Ultralytics COCO8-seg is a small, but versatile instance segmentation dataset composed of the first 8 images of the COCO
train 2017 set, 4 for training and 4 for validation. This dataset is ideal for testing and debugging segmentation
models, or for experimenting with new detection approaches. With 8 images, it is small enough to be easily manageable, 
yet diverse enough to test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before training larger datasets.

This dataset is intended for use with Ultralytics YOLOv8.
