# Ultralytics COCO8-Seg Dataset

## üìÑ Introduction

The **Ultralytics COCO8-Seg** dataset is a compact, easy-to-use resource for **instance segmentation** tasks. It contains the first 8 images from the [COCO 2017 train set](https://cocodataset.org/#home), split into 4 training and 4 validation images. This small yet diverse dataset is ideal for quickly testing and debugging [segmentation models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/) or experimenting with new [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) techniques.

With just 8 images, COCO8-Seg is highly manageable, making it perfect for verifying [training pipelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/model-training-tips/) and catching potential issues before scaling up to [larger datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/). It serves as a practical sanity check for model development and experimentation.

COCO8-Seg is designed for seamless integration with [Ultralytics HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com/) and the latest [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) models.

A Quick Guide](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/what-is-instance-segmentation-a-quick-guide).

## üñºÔ∏è Sample Images and Annotations

Below are sample images from the COCO8-Seg dataset, each with its corresponding segmentation mask annotation. These examples demonstrate the data format and the types of objects included, visualized in a training mosaic.
