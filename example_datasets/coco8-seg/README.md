# Ultralytics COCO8-Seg Dataset

## üìÑ Introduction

[Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) COCO8-Seg is a compact yet versatile **instance segmentation** dataset. It comprises the first 8 images from the [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) train 2017 set: 4 designated for training and 4 for validation. This dataset serves as an excellent tool for testing and debugging [segmentation models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/), or for experimenting with novel [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) approaches.

With only 8 images, COCO8-Seg is easily manageable while still offering enough diversity to verify [training pipelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/model-training-tips/) for potential errors. It acts as a practical sanity check before committing resources to training on [larger datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/).

This dataset is primarily intended for use with [Ultralytics HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com/) and the [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) model.
