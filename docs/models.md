# Ultralytics HUB Models

[Ultralytics HUB](https://bit.ly/ultralytics_hub) models provide a streamlined solution for training vision AI models on your custom datasets.

The process is user-friendly and efficient, involving a simple three-step creation and accelerated training powered by Utralytics YOLOv8. During training, real-time updates on model metrics are available so that you can monitor each step of the progress. Once training is completed, you can preview your model and easily deploy it to real-world applications. Therefore, Ultralytics HUB offers a comprehensive yet straightforward system for model creation, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Train Model

Navigate to the [Models](https://hub.ultralytics.com/models) page by clicking on the **Models** button in the sidebar.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Home page with an arrow pointing to the Models button in the sidebar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_1.jpg)

??? tip "Tip"

    You can also train a model directly from the [Home](https://hub.ultralytics.com/home) page.

    ![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Home page with an arrow pointing to the Train Model card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_2.jpg)

Click on the **Train Model** button on the top right of the page. This action will trigger the **Train Model** dialog.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Models page with an arrow pointing to the Train Model button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_3.jpg)

The **Train Model** dialog has three simple steps, explained below.

### 1. Dataset

In this step, you have to select the dataset you want to train your model on. After you selected a dataset, click **Continue**.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Train Model dialog with an arrow pointing to a dataset and one to the Continue button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_4.jpg)

??? tip "Tip"

    You can skip this step if you train a model directly from the Dataset page.

    ![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Dataset page with an arrow pointing to the Train Model button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_5.jpg)

### 2. Model

In this step, you have to choose the project in which you want to create your model, the name of your model and your model's architecture.

??? note "Note"

    Ultralytics HUB will try to pre-select the project.

    If you opened the **Train Model** dialog as described above, Ultralytics HUB will pre-select the last project you used.

    If you opened the **Train Model** dialog from the Project page, Ultralytics HUB will pre-select the project you were inside of.

    ![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Project page with an arrow pointing to the Train Model button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_6.jpg)

    In case you don't have a project created yet, you can set the name of your project in this step and it will be created together with your model.

    ![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Train Model dialog with an arrow pointing to the project name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_7.jpg)

!!! info "Info"

    You can read more about the available [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8) (and [YOLOv5](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5)) architectures in our documentation.

When you're happy with your model configuration, click **Continue**.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Train Model dialog with an arrow pointing to a model architecture and one to the Continue button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_8.jpg)

??? note "Note"

    By default, your model will use a pre-trained model (trained on the [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco) dataset) to reduce training time.

    You can change this behaviour by opening the **Advanced Options** accordion.

### 3. Train

In this step, you will start training you model.

Ultralytics HUB offers three training options:

- Ultralytics Cloud **(COMING SOON)**
- Google Colab
- Bring your own agent

In order to start training your model, follow the instructions presented in this step.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Train Model dialog with an arrow pointing to each step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_9.jpg)

??? note "Note"

    When you are on this step, before the training starts, you can change the default training configuration by opening the **Advanced Options** accordion.

    ![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Train Model dialog with an arrow pointing to the Train Advanced Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_10.jpg)

??? note "Note"

    When you are on this step, you have the option to close the **Train Model** dialog and start training your model from the Model page later.

    ![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Model page with an arrow pointing to the Start Training card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/models/hub_train_model_11.jpg)

To start training your model using Google Colab, simply follow the instructions shown above or on the Google Colab notebook.

    <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab">
</a>

When the training starts, you can click **Done** and monitor the training progress on the Model page.

## Share Model

!!! info "Info"

    Ultralytics HUB's sharing functionality provides a convenient way to share models with others. This feature is designed to accommodate both existing Ultralytics HUB users and those who have yet to create an account.

??? note "Note"

    You have control over the general access of your models.

    You can choose to set the general access to "Private", in which case, only you will have access to it. Alternatively, you can set the general access to "Unlisted" which grants viewing access to anyone who has the direct link to the model, regardless of whether they have an Ultralytics HUB account or not.

Navigate to the Model page of the model you want to share, open the model actions dropdown and click on the **Share** option. This action will trigger the **Share Model** dialog.
